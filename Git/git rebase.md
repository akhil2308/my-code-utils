When you encounter the message about divergent branches during a `git pull`, it means that your local branch and the remote branch have diverged and you need to decide how to reconcile them. You can choose to either merge the branches, rebase your changes onto the remote branch, or perform a fast-forward merge if possible.

Here's how to proceed:

### Option 1: Merge
Merging will create a merge commit combining the changes from both branches.

```bash
git pull origin main --no-rebase
# Resolve conflicts if any
git commit
```

### Option 2: Rebase
Rebasing will apply your local changes on top of the remote branch's changes.

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
# Resolve conflicts if any
git rebase --continue
```

### Option 3: Fast-forward only
This option will only work if your branch can be fast-forwarded to match the remote branch without any local commits.

```bash
git pull origin main --ff-only
```

### Example of Merging with Conflict Resolution
Here is a step-by-step guide for merging with conflict resolution:

1. **Pull with merge:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main --no-rebase
   ```

2. **Resolve conflicts:**
   - Git will notify you of any conflicts. Open the conflicting files and resolve the conflicts.
   - Conflict markers will look like this:
     ```plaintext
     <<<<<<< HEAD
     Your changes
     =======
     Changes from main
     >>>>>>> main
     ```
   - Edit the files to resolve the conflicts, then save and exit.

3. **Add the resolved files:**
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   ```

4. **Commit the merge:**
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

### Example of Rebasing with Conflict Resolution
Here is a step-by-step guide for rebasing with conflict resolution:

1. **Pull with rebase:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main --rebase
   ```

2. **Resolve conflicts:**
   - Git will notify you of any conflicts. Open the conflicting files and resolve the conflicts.
   - Conflict markers will look like this:
     ```plaintext
     <<<<<<< HEAD
     Your changes
     =======
     Changes from main
     >>>>>>> main
     ```
   - Edit the files to resolve the conflicts, then save and exit.

3. **Add the resolved files:**
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   ```

4. **Continue rebase:**
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

### Setting a Default Reconciliation Strategy
To avoid specifying the reconciliation strategy every time, you can set a default using `git config`.

1. **For merging:**
   ```bash
   git config pull.rebase false
   ```

2. **For rebasing:**
   ```bash
   git config pull.rebase true
   ```

3. **For fast-forward only:**
   ```bash
   git config pull.ff only
   ```

You can also set these globally using the `--global` flag if you want these settings to apply to all repositories on your machine:

```bash
git config --global pull.rebase false
git config --global pull.rebase true
git config --global pull.ff only
```

Choose the option that best fits your workflow and proceed accordingly.
